Train either a bidirectional or normal LSTM recurrent neural network to generate text using any dataset. No need to write any code. **Just upload your text file and click run!**

You can generate text after your model has finished training as well! Also you can continue training a pre-trained model if it needs more training.

**The best part is that all of the training is conducted on a free GPU courtesy of Colaboratory!**

If you would like to try it out: [go to this Colaboratory notebook.](https://colab.research.google.com/github/demmojo/colabrnn/blob/master/colabRNN.ipynb)
